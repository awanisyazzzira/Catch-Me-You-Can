Welcome to "Catch Me If You Can," a text-based detective game inspired by the pursuit of Frank Abagnale, a famous con artist. In this game, you step into the shoes of Detective Carl Hanratty, tasked with capturing Frank Abagnale before he reaches the airport. Frank is on the run, and you have only two chances to guess where he'll go next.
